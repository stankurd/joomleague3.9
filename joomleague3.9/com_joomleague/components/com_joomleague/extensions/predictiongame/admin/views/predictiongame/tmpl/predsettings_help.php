The allocation of points in the prediction game is freely configurable.<br /><br />
<b>Advice:</b> a proven point allocation would be 7,5,4,3,1 (the one point awards the regular participant)<br /><br>
Alternatively the widely known toto betting system (0,1,2) can be selected.<br /><br />
If you would like to provide a prediction game with Joker,activate the option here and set up the points.');
