MOD_JOOMLEAGUE_MATCHES_XML_DESC="This module shows a list of upcoming or past matches of projects fav teams or selected ones. You can enable arrows for switching to next / last match inside the module. This feature bases on AJAX - technology and requires user's Javascript to be turned on. You can also define a time range in which next matches are shown from the time you call the module. Additionally you can decide if the server offset you set in joomleague's project configuration shall be used or not. The number of recent matches can be limited. See readme.txt included in this package for detailed information! Have phun! ;-)"
